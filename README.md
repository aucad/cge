# Constrained adversarial attacks

[![Build](https://github.com/aucad/new-experiments/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aucad/new-experiments/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This implementation demonstrates adding constraints to unconstrained adversarial machine learning evasion attacks.
We introduce a _constraint validation_ algorithm that guarantees generated evasive adversarial examples satisfy domain constraints.
We call evasive examples that satisfy domain constraints _valid_.

This implementation allows running various adversarial evasion attacks, enhanced with our constraint validation algorithm, on different data sets and classifiers.
The following options are included.

- **Attacks**: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), HopSkipJump attack. These attacks are modified to use our constraint validation algorithm.
- **Classifiers**: Keras deep neural network and tree-based ensemble XGBoost.
- **Data sets**: 4 different data sets from different domains, see descriptions below.

**Comparison.** We also include a comparison attack, Constrained Projected Gradient Descent (C-PGD).
It uses a different constraint evaluation approach, introduced by Simonetto et al. in ["A Unified Framework for Adversarial Attack and Defense in Constrained Feature Space"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01156).

<summary>Notes on preprocessing and sampling</summary>
<ul>
<li>The input data must be numeric and parse to a numeric type (<code>NULL</code> should be a null, not <code>-</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>Categorical attributes must be one-hot encoded.</li>
<li>Data sets should not be normalized, because this will be done automatically (otherwise the constraints must include manual scaling).</li>
<li>All data sets have an equal 50/50 class distribution.</li>
<li>The provided sampled data sets were generated by random sampling, without replacement, using Weka's supervised instance <a href="https://waikato.github.io/weka-blog/posts/2019-01-30-sampling/" target="_blank">SpreadSubsample</a>.</li>

## Experiment workflow

A single experiment consists of training a classification model on a choice data set and applying an adversarial attack to that model. A constraint-validation approach can be enabled or disabled during the attack to impact the validity of the generated adversarial examples.

## Usage

**Software requirements**

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) -- version 3.9 or higher
* [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) -- version 3.81 or later

Check your environment using the following command, and install/upgrade as necessary.

```
python3 --version & make --version
```

### Reproducing experiments

Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

**Run attacks.** Run experiments with validation, for all combinations of data sets, classifiers, and attacks.       
🕒 Running all experiments takes 1--2 days.

```
make attacks
```

**Run more experiments.** Run more experiments to compare with the above baseline attacks.      
🕒 A performance test takes 30 min -- 3 h, and the other experiments take 1--2 days.

<pre>
make original  -- run all attacks, but without validation (ignore constraints).
make reset     -- run all attacks, but use naive reset strategy.
make perf      -- run constraint performance tests. 
</pre>

### Visualizations

**Plots.** Generate plots of experiment results.

```
make plots
```

**Comparison plot.** To plot results from some other directory, e.g. `ref_result` append directory name.

```
make plots DIR=ref_result
```

## Extended and custom usage

The default experiment options are defined statically in `config` files.
An experiment run can be customized further with command line arguments, to override the static options.
To run such custom experiments, call the `exp` module directly.

```
python3 -m exp [PATH] {ARGS}
```

For a list of supported arguments, run:

```
python3 -m exp --help
```

All plotting utilities live separately from experiments in `plot` module.
For plotting help, run:

```
python3 -m plot --help
```
