# Constrained adversarial attacks

This is an experimental setup that demonstrates adding constraints to universal adversarial machine learning evasion attacks.
We introduce a _constraint validation_ algorithm that guarantees generated evasive adversarial examples satisfy domain constraints.
We call evasive examples that satisfy domain constraints _valid_.

This implementation allows to run various adversarial evasion attacks, enhanced with our constraint validation algorithm, on different data sets and classifiers.
The following options are included.

- **Attacks**: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), HopSkipJump attack. These attacks are modified to use our constraint validation algorithm.
- **Classifiers**: Keras deep neural network and tree-based ensemble XGBoost.
- **Data sets**: 4 different data sets from different domains, see descriptions below.

**Comparison.** We also include a comparison attack, Constrained Projected Gradient Descent (C-PGD).
It uses a different constraint evaluation approach, introduced by Simonetto et al. in ["A Unified Framework for Adversarial Attack and Defense in Constrained Feature Space"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01156).

<summary>Notes on sampling</summary>
All data sets have an equal 50/50 class distribution.
The sampled data sets were generated by random sampling, without replacement, to obtain equal class distribution using Weka's supervised instance <a href="https://waikato.github.io/weka-blog/posts/2019-01-30-sampling/" target="_blank">SpreadSubsample</a>.

## Experiment workflow

A single experiment execution consists of training a classification model on a choice data set, and then applying an adversarial attack on  that model. 
A constraint-validation approach can be enabled or disabled during the attack, to impact the validity of the generated adversarial examples.

## Usage

**Software requirements**

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) -- version 3.9 or higher
* [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) -- version 3.81 or later

Check your environment using the following command, and install/upgrade as necessary.

```
python3 --version && make --version
```

### Reproducing experiments

Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

**Run attacks.** Run experiments for all combinations of data sets, classifiers and attacks.       
🕒 Important: depending on architecture, running all experiments takes 1-2 days.

```
make attacks
```

**Run comparisons.** For comparison of the above baseline attacks with validation, run further experiments.      
🕒 Depending on hardware, a performance test takes 30 min -- 3 hours, and the other experiments take 1-2 days.

<pre>
make original  -- run all attacks, but ignore constraints.
make reset     -- run all attacks, but using naive reset strategy.
make perf      -- run constraint performance tests. 
</pre>

### Visualizations

**Plots.** Generate plots of experiment results.

```
make plots
```

**Comparison plot.** To plot results from some other directory, e.g. `ref_result` append directory name.

```
make plots DIR=ref_result
```

**Plot graphs.** To visualize constraints as graphs.

```
make graphs
```

### Custom usage

The default experiment options are defined statically in `config` files.
An experiment run can be customized further with command line arguments, to override the static options.
To run such custom experiments, call the `exp` module directly.

```
python3 -m exp [PATH] {ARGS}
```

For a list of supported arguments, run:

```
python3 -m exp --help
```

All plotting utilities live separately from experiments, in `plot` module.
For plotting help, run:

```
python3 -m plot --help
```
